        <h3>LION</h3>
        <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the most iconic and powerful big cats, known for its majestic mane and social behavior. Lions live in prides, which consist of a group of females, their cubs, and a few dominant males.</p>
        <p>They are apex predators, primarily found in the grasslands and savannas of Africa, though a small population still exists in India s Gir Forest.</p>
        <p>Lions have roamed the Earth for hundreds of thousands of years. Fossil evidence traces their ancestry back over 2 million years, with lions once inhabiting Europe, Asia, and North America.</p>
        <p>They were widespread during the Pleistocene epoch but eventually disappeared from many regions due to climate changes and human activity.</p>
        <p>In ancient cultures, lions symbolized strength, courage, and royalty. They were featured in Egyptian mythology, depicted in Mesopotamian art, and revered in medieval European heraldry.</p>
        <p>Historically, lions have had an uneasy relationship with humansâ€”sometimes feared, often respected, and tragically hunted. Today, habitat loss and poaching have led to their classification as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List.</p>
