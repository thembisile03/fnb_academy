        <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
          <P>The gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is a strikingly beautiful and resilient antelope native to the arid regions of Southern Africa, including Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe</P>
          <p>It thrives in harsh desert environments like the Kalahari and Namib Deserts, where it has adapted to survive with minimal wate
          <p>Appearance: Gemsbok have a light taupe to tan coat with bold black-and-white facial markings and long, straight horns that can reach up to 120 cm 47 inches
          <p>Size: They stand about 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall at the shoulder, with males weighin
          <p>Diet: Primarily grazers, but they also dig for roots and tubers to extract moisture, allowing them to survive in extreme drought condition
          <p>Behavior: Gemsbok live in herds of 1040 animals, led by a dominant male. They use their sharp horns for defense against predators like lions and hyenas
          <p>This majestic antelope is highly adapted to desert life, making it one of Africaâ€™s most iconic species. Want to see some pictures? I can find some for you!
