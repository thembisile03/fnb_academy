        <h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
          <p>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, known for their intelligence, strong social bonds, and remarkable memory. They belong to the family Elephantidae, which includes three species:</p>
          <P>African Savanna Elephant (Loxodonta africana) the largest species, found in open plains and woodlands
          <P>African Forest Elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis) smaller and more elusive, living in dense forests of Central and West Africa</P>
          <P>Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) slightly smaller than their African counterparts, with smaller ears and found in India, Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka.</P>
          <P>Elephants play a crucial role in ecosystems by shaping landscapes, dispersing seeds, and creating water sources used by other animals. Their intelligence rivals that of primates, with problem-solving abilities, self-awareness, and deep emotional connections within their herds.</P>
