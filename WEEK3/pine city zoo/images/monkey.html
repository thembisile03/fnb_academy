        <h3>MONKEY</h3>
        <p>Monkeys are primates known for their intelligence, agility, and social behavior. They are divided into two main groups: New World monkeys (found in South America) and Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia). Unlike apes, monkeys typically have tails and are smaller in size.</p>
        <p>Monkeys have been around for millions of years, evolving from early primates that lived in trees. Fossil evidence suggests that primates first appeared around 55 million years ago, with monkeys branching off later.</p>
        <p>Over time, they adapted to different environments, leading to the diverse species we see today.></p>
        <p>In human history, monkeys have been depicted in ancient art and mythology. Egyptian tomb paintings, Minoan frescoes, and medieval manuscripts often featured monkeys, sometimes as symbols of mischief or wisdom</p>
        <p>In some cultures, they are revered like the Hanuman monkey god in Hinduism.</p>
        <p>Monkeys also played a role in scientific discoveries, particularly in evolutionary studies. While humans did not evolve directly from monkeys, we share a common ancestor with them that lived millions of years ago</p>
