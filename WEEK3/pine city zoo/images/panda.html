            <h3>PANDA</h3>
            <p>The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a unique bear species native to China, known for its
                distinctive black-and-white fur and bamboo-heavy diet. Despite being classified as a carnivore, pandas
                primarily eat bamboo, thanks to their specialized teeth and digestive system.</p>
            <p>Pandas have existed for at least 8 million years, evolving from bear-like ancestors. Fossil evidence
                suggests that early pandas lived in humid forests, adapting over time to their bamboo diet. By the
                Pleistocene epoch, around 500,000 to 700,000 years ago, different subspecies of pandas emerged</p>
            <p>Historically, pandas were considered rare and mysterious creatures in China. Ancient texts mention them
                under various names, and they were sometimes gifted to emperors as symbols of peace</p>
            <p>he scientific discovery of pandas occurred in 1869, when French missionary Armand David documented the
                species after seeing a panda skin in Sichuan.</p>
            <p>In the 20th century, pandas gained global attention, especially after Ruth Harkness brought an infant
                panda to the USA in 1936, sparking worldwide fascination. Conservation efforts intensified in the 1970s,
                leading to the establishment of panda reserves and protective laws</p>
            <p>Today, pandas are classified as vulnerable, with ongoing conservation programs ensuring their survival.
