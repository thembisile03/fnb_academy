        <h3>KOALA</h3>
        <p>Koalas are adorable, tree-dwelling marsupials native to Australia.</p>
        <p>Despite often being called "koala bears," they are not bears at all but rather closely related to wombats and kangaroos.</p>
        <p>These fluffy creatures spend most of their time in eucalyptus trees, munching on leaves and sleeping for up to 18,20 hours a day talk about living the dream!</p>
        <p>Koalas have been around for millions of years, evolving in the forests of Australia. Fossil evidence suggests their ancestors existed as early as 30 million years ago, adapting over time to their eucalyptus-heavy diet.</p>
        <p>Indigenous Australian cultures have long held koalas in high regard, depicting them in stories and rock art</p>
        <p>However, when European settlers arrived in Australia, koalas faced a troubling history. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were hunted extensively for their soft fur, causing a severe decline in populations. Conservation efforts kicked in during the 1920s, and today, while still facing threats from habitat destruction, climate change, and disease, koalas are protected by law.</p>
