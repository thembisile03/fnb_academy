        <h3>GORILLA</h3>
        <P>Gorillas are the largest living primates and are closely related to humans, sharing about 96,99% of our DNA.</P>
        <P>They are primarily herbivorous and inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa.</P>
        <P>Gorillas are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, with several subspecies.</P>
        <p>Historically, gorillas were first documented by Western scientists in the 19th century, though indigenous African communities had long known about them.</p>
        <p>The name "gorilla" comes from a Carthaginian explorer's account of a tribe of hairy people, recorded over 2,500 years ago</p>
        <p>Gorillas evolved from a common ancestor shared with humans and chimpanzees, diverging around 7,11 million years ago.</p>
        <p>hey have been studied extensively for their intelligence, social structures, and tool use</p>
