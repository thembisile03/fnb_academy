            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
            <p>Warthogs have been around for millions of years, evolving from early pig-like ancestors. Fossil evidence
                suggests that their lineage dates back to the Miocene epoch, around 23 million years ago</p>
            <P>Over time, they adapted to Africas diverse landscapes, developing their characteristic tusks for defense
                and digging.</P>
            <P>Historically, warthogs have been depicted in African folklore and art, often symbolizing resilience and
                survival. Unlike many large mammals, warthogs have remained relatively stable in population, though they
                face threats from habitat loss and hunting</P>
            <P>Interestingly, they are known for their unique feeding behavior, often kneeling on their front legs to
                graze.</P>
